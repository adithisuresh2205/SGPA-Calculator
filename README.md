🎓 SGPA Calculator in C

This is a simple yet efficient **SGPA Calculator** written in the C programming language. It allows users to input subject grades as letter grades (like `O`, `A+`, `P`, etc.) along with credit values and then calculates the **Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)** accordingly.


📌 Features

- Accepts **letter grades** (O, A+, A, B+, B, C, P, F)
- Grade points are automatically mapped based on predefined rules
- Handles **floating-point precision** (e.g., A+ = 9.5)
- Calculates CGPA using:  
  \[
  \text{SGPA} = \frac{\sum (\text{Grade Point} \times \text{Credits})}{\sum (\text{Credits})}
  \]
- Error handling for invalid grade inputs
